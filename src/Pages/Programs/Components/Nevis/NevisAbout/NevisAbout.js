    text="Saint Kitts and Nevis is one of the most beautiful Caribbean islands and is a convenient location for businessmen to relax in picturesque nature. Saint Kitts and Nevis launched the Citizenship by Investment Program in 1984, making it the worldâ€™s first program of its kind. The state grants life citizenship to investors for a period of 6-9 months. It has become the first choice for any investor looking for a second passport by investing in government-approved real estate or through direct support to the Economic Development Fund in St. Kitts and Nevis."
